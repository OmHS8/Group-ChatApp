# Group-ChatApp

An interactive, hassle-free Group ChatApp developed in Flutter and Python.
Web server is written in python and connects in realtime to socket client i.e. Flutter App.

Just enter a username and get on to chat with anonymous users present on server.

Currently it is configured for emulators so the socket address is fixed and can be changed in server_provider.dart file.

Upcoming features:-
- Addition of more servers.
- Storing pervious data.
- Suggesting stickers based on user responses.
